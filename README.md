DESCRIPTION :

This project focuses on automating the generation of a professional PDF report from tabular data using Python. The program performs the following tasks:

Data Loading:
The program reads structured data from a CSV file using the pandas library. This dataset typically contains rows of individuals with attributes such as name, age, and score.

Data Summarization:
Using pandas.DataFrame.describe(), it computes statistical summaries including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numeric columns.

PDF Generation:

The reportlab library is used to create a multi-page PDF:

The first page contains the title, timestamp, and original data in table format.

The second page contains statistical summaries, presented as a table.

Timestamping:

The current date and time of report creation are dynamically added to the PDF for tracking and record-keeping purposes.

Error Handling:

The code includes basic exception handling to manage errors such as missing files or data issues.

Key Features:

Automated report creation with minimal user input

Dynamic timestamp generation

PDF output formatted for readability

Tabular data visualization without manual formatting

Modular functions for loading data, processing, and rendering

Technologies Used:

Python for programming

Pandas for data manipulation

ReportLab for PDF generation

Datetime for timestamp creation

Applications:

Academic reporting (student scores, attendance)

Employee or intern performance summaries

Survey result summaries

Automated documentation for business or research
